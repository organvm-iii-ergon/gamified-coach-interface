### Organization & cleanup
- A living blueprint for the repo layout and proposed moves lives in `docs/REPO_STRUCTURE.md`.
- The step-by-step path to a working prototype is tracked in `docs/WORKING_PROTOTYPE_CHECKLIST.md`.
- Frontend environment variables now live in `.env` (Gemini key + backend URL). Copy and fill it before running `npm run dev`.

## 🛠️ Build for Production

To create a production build:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will generate optimized files in the `dist/` directory.

To preview the production build:

```bash
npm run preview
```

## 📖 Python Document Analysis

### Requirements

- Python 3.11+
- python-docx library

### Installation

1. Clone the repository (if not already done):
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ivi374forivi/gamified-coach-interface.git
cd gamified-coach-interface
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Run the document analyzer:

```bash
python3 analyze_docs.py
```

The script will:
1. Scan the repository for `.docx` files
2. Ingest and parse each document
3. Analyze the content to extract key topics and statistics
4. Provide a suggested development path based on the analysis

## Output

The analyzer provides:
- List of ingested documents
- Document statistics (paragraph count, word count)
- Key topics extracted from each document
- Categorization of documents (fitness, business, gamification themes)
- Recommended development path with actionable steps
- Suggested next steps for implementation

## Documents in Repository

The repository contains several key documents:
- **Blueprint for a Niche Fitness Coaching Enterprise**: Deep dive into the Gamified Life Model
- **Gym Chimera**: Specific fitness coaching concepts
- **The Gamified Life**: Formal and casual perspective on gamification
- **The Legion of Fitness**: Battle plan and interrogation strategies

## Development Path

## Development Path

The recommended development phases are generated dynamically based on the content and themes found in the analyzed documents. The system identifies relevant topics and suggests actionable phases accordingly.

For example:
- If a document focuses only on fitness, the suggested phases may include:
  1. **Foundation**: Core data models and user profiles
  2. **Interface**: User dashboard and tracking tools
  3. **Coaching Features**: Personalized recommendations and goal tracking
- If business or gamification topics are present, additional phases such as **Gamification** and **Business Integration** may be included.

Possible phases include:
- **Foundation**: Core data models and user profiles
- **Interface**: User dashboard and tracking tools
- **Coaching Features**: Personalized recommendations and goal tracking
- **Gamification**: Achievement systems and challenges
- **Business Integration**: Payments, communication, and analytics
Based on the document analysis, the recommended development phases are:

1. **Foundation**: Core data models and user profiles
2. **Interface**: User dashboard and tracking tools
