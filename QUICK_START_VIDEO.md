## 📞 Common Questions

### "I've never made a video before. Can I do this?"

**Yes!** The script is written. The visuals are specified. The guide walks you through step-by-step. Start with Path B (MVP version) and iterate.

### "Do I need to show the actual code?"

**No.** In fact, don't. This video is for non-technical audiences. Show outcomes, diagrams, and the UI—never code.

### "What if my voice sounds bad?"

**Practice makes better.** Record multiple takes. Use audio editing. Or hire a voiceover artist on Fiverr ($50-150). Your voice is likely better than you think.

### "How long will this take?"

**Realistically:** 10-40 hours depending on path chosen and experience level. Budget 2-4 weeks for a quality result without rushing.

### "Is this worth the effort?"

**If you're pursuing strategic/leadership roles:** Yes, absolutely. This positions you differently than 99% of technical portfolios.

**If you're pursuing pure coding roles:** Maybe not. Focus on technical depth instead.
